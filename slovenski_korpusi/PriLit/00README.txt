This directory contains the plain text (i.e. without any annotations
whatsoever) of the corpus in three variants:
- *.orig.txt: the original texts;
- *.norm.txt: the automatically word-normalised (modernised) texts;
- *.lemma.txt: the text lemmas.

The text files contain one paragraph per line.

Also included is PriLit-meta.tsv, a TSV file with the metadata of the
corpus texts.
