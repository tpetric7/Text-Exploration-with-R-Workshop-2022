This directory contains the linguistically annotated corpus in the so
called vertical format (derived from the source TEI), as used by
various concordancers, in particular CQP and Manatee (i.e. Sketch
Engine and noSketch Engine).

Also included is the registry file maj68.regi for noSketch Engine as
used for the corpus mounted on the CLARIN.SI concordancers.
